This branch has an example of how to get a number of tweets from
Twitter, get the username of the tweeter and the text within the tweet,
then export it to a csv file (trying.csv)

The 3 files to look at are:
- app2political.js    (name is misleading sorry)
- thisisus.js
- trying.csv

If you run app2political.js, it will update trying.csv with some tweets.

Hopefully this helps a bit if you are new to node.js (like myself) and
are having trouble with syntax.


(ignore politicalstuff.js --- it's just some code I've been dumping in from time to time while I'm figuring stuff out)
