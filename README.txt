Scrapping almost everything so far to make an app that recieves post requests per Twitter event via a webhook url.

App index url : https://jurassic-world-mediatech-bot.herokuapp.com
App webhook url : https://jurassic-world-mediatech-bot.herokuapp.com/webhooks/twitter

Finally freaking works. Just need to process the events my webhook url recieves. Excited for this!!!

Will be removing all unecessary files soon after, and will put up examples of my requests + write up a short tutorial on how this works.
